# RoyalMTLS Light Novel Scraper and PDF Converter

This Python project allows you to scrape light novels from [RoyalMTLS](https://royalmtls.com/) website, save the scraped chapters into a text file, and then convert the content into a properly formatted PDF. The project supports custom fonts, handles special characters (such as `≈ç`), and automatically deletes the intermediate text file after generating the PDF.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Scrapes chapters of light novels from RoyalMTLS website using BeautifulSoup.
- **Automatic PDF Creation:** Converts the scraped content into a PDF, with custom formatting for chapter titles and body text.
- **Custom Font Support:** Uses DejaVu Sans fonts to properly render special characters and ensure clean text presentation.
- **Automated Cleanup:** Deletes the intermediate text file after the PDF has been generated.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles issues like missing chapters or failed HTTP requests.

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `reportlab`

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the scraper by executing the following command.
